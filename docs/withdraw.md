# Withdraw

You can withdraw your original deposit anytime in full

## Fairness

In order to ensure fairness there is a 7 day minimum deposit to avoid a small fee. 

## Why?

Without a fee it would be possible to game the system by being eligible to win without contributing to the prize.  The fairness fee guarantees a fair playing field.  

### Fee Amount

<!-- TODO fetch fee and time from contract -->

The fee is 1% and decays over the 7 days to zero.

Example - If you deposit 10 staked ETH tokens the fee would be .01 tokens on day one and zero after seven days.  You will never receive less than 9.99 tokens back and after ten days you would always receive a minimum of your original deposit 10 staked ETH.
